description:
he password for the next level can be retrieved by submitting the password of the current level to port 30001 on localhost using SSL encryption.

Helpful note: Getting “HEARTBEATING” and “Read R BLOCK”? Use -ign_eof and read the “CONNECTED COMMANDS” section in the manpage. Next to ‘R’ and ‘Q’, the ‘B’ command also works in this version of that command…

solution:
we have to use *openssl*
*openssl s_client -connect bandit.labs.overthewire.org:30001*
then we use the given password which gives us to another level
