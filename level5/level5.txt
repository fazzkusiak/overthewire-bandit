description:
The password for the next level is stored in a file somewhere under the inhere directory and has all of the following properties:

human-readable
1033 bytes in size
not executable

solution:
so we have to look for file with given properties
cant find this file by *find . -size -1033b* somehow
so ive used *find. !executable | xargs tail -n +1*
ive got some files with the passwords, there arent so many, so I've found one which works
