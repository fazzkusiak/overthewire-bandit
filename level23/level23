description:
A program is running automatically at regular intervals from cron, the time-based job scheduler. Look in /etc/cron.d/ for the configuration and see what command is being executed.

NOTE: This level requires you to create your own first shell-script. This is a very big step and you should be proud of yourself when you beat this level!

NOTE 2: Keep in mind that your shell script is removed once executed, so you may want to keep a copy aroundâ€¦

solution:
the script is happening after restart and every minute, it executes scripts and deletes the files that are responsible for them, they are done by bandit24, in order to get password I've wrote a small script
* #! bin/bash
*cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit24 > /tmp/h3l0*

previously Ive created h3l0 folder in tmp and gave 777 permissions
then I've executed this scripting, which gave me the password
