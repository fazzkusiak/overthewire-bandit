Logging in to bandit26 from bandit25 should be fairly easyâ€¦ The shell for user bandit26 is not /bin/bash, but something else. Find out what it is, how it works and how to break out of it.

solution:
if we look at /etc/passwd locaiton we can see that we are loading not the /bin/bash, but some file which uses more command. after that we can get the access to this user only if we can avoid connection close. we can do that by resizing our termninal windows to max 6, then we can use vim editor, where we can get the password by typing 
*:e /etc/bandit_pass/level26*

then we set shell
:set shell=/bin/bash
:bash

and we have access to bash
