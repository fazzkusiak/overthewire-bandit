description:
There is a setuid binary in the homedirectory that does the following: it makes a connection to localhost on the port you specify as a commandline argument. It then reads a line of text from the connection and compares it to the password in the previous level (bandit20). If the password is correct, it will transmit the password for the next level (bandit21).

NOTE: Try connecting to your own network daemon to see if it works as you think

solution:
you have to listen netcat on some port (3000), by *nc -l 3000*, then you have to launch setuid binary file, in the netcat console pass the previous level password, then you can get password to the next level
