description:
There is a git repository at ssh://bandit28-git@localhost/home/bandit28-git/repo. The password for the user bandit28-git is the same as for the user bandit28.

Clone the repository and find the password for the next level.

solution:
after cloning repo we have to look for
*git log* 
we can see there were 3 commits, which one 'covers' password, second one contains password, we can get it by *git reset --hard*
