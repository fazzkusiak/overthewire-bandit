description: 
The password for the next level is stored in a file called readme located in the home directory. Use this password to log into bandit1 using SSH. Whenever you find a password for a level, use SSH (on port 2220) to log into that level and continue the game.

solution:
ls to look for the file which is in corresponding location, there is a readme file, by *cat readme* we are getting the password which is required to get level2
